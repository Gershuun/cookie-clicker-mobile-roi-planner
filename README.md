# Cookie Clicker Mobile ROI Planner — Standalone + Save Vault
Single-file web app (just `index.html`). Paste your Cookie Clicker **save code TXT** and press **Save code** to store it locally. No decoding required.

## Use on phone
1. Open your live GitHub Pages URL or just open `index.html` locally.
2. Tap **Save vault** to view previously saved codes.
3. Tap **Import save** → paste your TXT → **Save code (no decoding)** to stash it for later.
4. Use **Export JSON** if you want to back up the planner’s settings (separate from your raw TXT codes).

Everything is saved locally (localStorage). No accounts, no servers.
