# Cookie Clicker Mobile ROI Planner — Vault + Profiles
Single-file web app. Save multiple **raw TXT codes** to your vault and switch between **profiles** without decoding.

## What this adds
- **Save Vault** — stash raw mobile export strings with labels and timestamps.
- **Profiles** — link a full planner state to each saved code. Switch profiles instantly (your app will “look different” per profile).
- **Decode → Apply (beta)** — optional button that tries to read milk % and building counts from a code and apply them to the linked profile (you can ignore this if you never want decoding).

## Use on phone
1. Open your live URL.
2. Tap **Import save** and paste your code → **Save code**.
3. Open **Save vault** → for any entry, tap **Save current as profile** to link the current planner state to that code (or **Decode → Apply (beta)** to auto-fill milk/buildings).
4. Tap **Apply profile** to switch the app to that saved state.

Everything stays on your device (localStorage).
